I have spearheaded the development of web-based, clientserver, and distributed architecture applications using Java Technologies and JavaScript libraries for diverse clients, contributing to both front-end and back-end development. I have successfully transitioned monolithic applications to microservices architecture for clients in the Telecommunication and Healthcare sectors. I have played a key role in DevOps, ensuring seamless integration between systems and maintaining data consistency.
